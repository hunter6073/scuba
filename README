This is the second version of the Simple C Utility for I/O Benchmark Analysis
the version is mature and can run on both linux bash and Slurm for multi node preference.

You can generate the output by running

./runscript.sh 1000    # giving it an argument of how many memory blocks we require

or 

./runscript.sh # using the default number of memory blocks, which is 10 at the moment

or

sbatch runscript # the same as running ./runscript.sh, but in slurm


currently, this code has yielded a result of 1500 memory block writes,


1500 memory block of 10 KB or less, each written to 100 files, making it 150000 files output in total.

The total time is 154549 miliseconds, or 154.5 seconds

------------version 3.0
now we can set the file size distribution arbitrarily, by locating the following code, 
and changing the folloing parameters, you can set the file distribution
#code section:
#
# int setpoint[8] = {20,50,70,90,100,125,150,160};
#    for(i=0;i<iblock_size;i++)
#    {
#        n = setpoint[i%8]*1000; // n will float along the lines of the setpoint value
#        mp[i]= (char*)malloc(n);
#        memoryarr[i] = n;
#        output[i] = (char*)malloc(200);
#    }
the setpoint array is the number of file size distribution key points, each point will conglomerate 100 random files within a 5 kb range,
tweaking the array will give you the results you require,the items in the array are the size(Kb) of each file distribution point.
